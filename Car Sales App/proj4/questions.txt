remove only really checks the deleted ratio

insert checks really only the lambda function

copy and paste the hashmaker and checker code for every test

only transfer 25 percent of the data. then if the old table exists, transfer another 25 percent. 
        do this until the old table is empty. 
        possibly 5 iterations because size is prime.
