is there not a m_prior variable?
    do i have to call the function 
    pointer every time?
        if so, what is the syntax for that?

        - m_priorFunc(patient)

what are the data types of the parameters to 
    pass to the insert helpers and the merge helpers

    - up to me

are the ~ and clear op the same

    -yes

set priority and set structure can both
    be done with insert function?

    - pointer to old heap passse dot helper will then return rebuilt tree 

insert function can be helped with the merge function?

    - pretty much just is merge

do i need two merge functions? 
    for the two structures? or do i just need two for the different heaptypes

    - pass two node*
    - 

print function should work like writen?

    - yes

chat GPT has answers on theory of how to write the merges. 


-------- where i left off... ------------
    - work on rebuild helper and use that instead of the heap copy thing. maybe itll finally work for some reason idk man
